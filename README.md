# Tic_Tac_Toe_Final Project
 
Hello and welcome to the tic tac toe application! This is a rather simple game application, where you choose who is player 1 (represented as the X’s) and player 2 (represented by the O’s). Player 1 gets to go first and the game ends if either one of the players’ win or there is a tie. If you want to play the game again, you can simply hit the run button again and the game will return to its original state.
